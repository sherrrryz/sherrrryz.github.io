          A Graphic Designer
          </h2>

          <p class="wrapdetail">
          I am Icy Leng, a graphic designer from China. I am currently living in the amazing city of Los Angeles doing my MFA graduate program in Graphic Design at Otis College of Art and Design.

After receiving my bachelors degree in Graphic Design from Nomal University of Central China in Wuhan, China,I enjoyed working as a creative designer & branding specialist for Wuhan Metro Group. Then I had opened my own studio named "Magic Eye". I have since decided to continue my design studies in LA in order to explore its complex design community.

As a designer, I am inspired by people's emotions and the way they perceive information. The visual message from a designer to a viewer is what I call graphic design.

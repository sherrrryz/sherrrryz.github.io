            The series of photos are taken before and during the period of removing the old urban area of my hometown. I expect to express my nostalgia for the old urban area personally and my understanding of the conflict between modernity and tradition by two different means of expression. This is the demolishing of old buildings, as well as the history, stories and life style of the generations. What I can do is to record the ancient places through the photos, keeping the memory and stories which are happened there.

In my memory, the old urban area, an isolated place with many stories, is shabby and has experienced a lot. I hope to keep the easeful life style. Walking around the Hu tong, it is easy to find that you are adjust to the life there and I hope to leave the comfortable life and stories of the old urban area by my photos.

At the end of 2012, demolition and reconstruction of Guanzha Camping area of Baohua Street in Jinan City, which has been doing for almost half year is nearly completed. The mottled wall, scattering photos, abandoned toys…… In the process of demolition, the abandoned stuff which record the past life is disappearing and it will become the memory of the city in future.

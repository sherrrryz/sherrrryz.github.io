                <h3>Januart 20th</h3>
                <p>Nothing says fun design like cartoon appendages being used as graphic devices, so that would make The Rodina (made up by Vit Musil, Radim Petruška and Tereza Rullerová) very fun indeed. Unapologetically aesthetic glitches and textures with a graphic vernacular that sounds/looks like – without taking itself too seriously – more art than design, but still equally as communicative.

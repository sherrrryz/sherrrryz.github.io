                <h1> Anout the lecture series</h1>
                <p>Nothing says fun design like cartoon appendages being used as graphic devices, so that would make The Rodina (made up by Vit Musil, Radim Petruška and Tereza Rullerová) very fun indeed. Unapologetically aesthetic glitches and textures with a graphic vernacular that sounds/looks like – without taking itself too seriously – more art than design, but still equally as communicative.</p>
                <p>From VJ animations to a whole load of posters and flyers and identities, classic design this is not. However, the quality and consistency of the studio’s prolific output will no doubt afford it longevity, delivered as it seemingly is from its own principality where the ruling leader is the God of Internet, the most Honourable Post Modern.</p>

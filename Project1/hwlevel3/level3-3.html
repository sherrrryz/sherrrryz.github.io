        <p>I Believe in Unicorns</p>
        <p>He stood in snow white splendor</p>
        <p>Among the leaves of green</p>
        <p>Eyes of rich brown velvet</p>
        <p>The most beautiful ever seen</p>
        </div>
        <br><br>
        
        <h7>
        <p>A faint trace of a spiral</p>
        <p>Around a silvery horn</p>
        <p>Was I dreaming or did I really see</p>         
        <p>A unicorn?</p>
        </h7>
        <br><br>
        
        <h8>
        <p>A creamy beard softly hung</p>
        <p>From off his shapely chin</p>
        <p>An ivory flowing mane and tail</p>
        <p>Blew gently in the wind</p>
        <p>He slowly raised his head, to gaze</p>
        <P>With eyes of mystic wonder</P>
        <P>My mind was caught in the magic spell</P>
        <P>His presence cast me under</P>
        </h8>
        <br><br>
        
        <h9>
        <P>Then suddenly with a toss of his head</P>
        <P>And a flash of pearly hooves</P>
        <P>I stood, spellbound, as he disappeared</P>
        <P>Into the silent woods</P>
        <P>Legend says only young maidens</P>
        <P>Can see his lovely form</P>
        <P>But I know I wasn't dreaming when I saw</P>
        <P>The <span>unicorn</span></P>
        </h9>
